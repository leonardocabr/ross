"""Cutting the shaft line into elements short enough for the model to be right.

THE RULE. API RP 684 (Tutorial on the API Standard Paragraphs Covering Rotor
Dynamics and Balancing, 1st ed., 1996), section 1.5.2.1, "Division of Rotor
into Discrete Sections": the rotor is first divided at every step of its
outside or inside diameter, and then

    a. the length to diameter ratio of any section should not exceed 1.0
       (0.5 is preferred) -- enough resolution for the first three critical
       speeds;
    b. the length to diameter ratio of any section should not be less than
       0.10 -- very different lengths side by side can make the numbers go
       wrong.

The first division is the user's: each shaft row is a section they drew. This
module does the second: every element longer than `max_ld` diameters is cut
into as few equal parts as keep each of them at or under it -- so no node the
model has is lost, and every disk, bearing and seal stays where it was. An
element shorter than `min_ld` diameters cannot be fixed by cutting, and is
reported.

ROSS does the same to a built rotor, `Rotor.refine_mesh`, written with this
module, and `tests/test_meshing.py` holds the two to the same answer. This one
does not call it, for the reasons `domain/splitting.py` gives for not calling
`add_nodes`: the project carries what a `Rotor` does not (the material by
name, the model, the tags, every field of the form), and meshing is modelling
-- done on a model that may not build yet.

The diameter is the element's largest outer one, so a taper is cut by its
thick end. Elements on the same pair of nodes -- a sleeve over a shaft -- are
cut together, by the largest of them. A span holding a coupling is left whole:
a coupling is one element in ROSS, and cannot be cut.
