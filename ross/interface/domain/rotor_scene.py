"""What the 3D view draws: the rotor ROSS built, as geometry in SI.

The 3D view is a *view*, like the element list and like ROSS's own 2D figure.
It has no model of its own: the project is still the only description of the
rotor, and ROSS is still the only thing that turns it into one. This module
reads the rotor ROSS just built -- the same one `/build_rotor` draws in 2D, from
the same cache -- and writes down what a drawing needs, so the two views can
never disagree about where anything is.

Why here and not in the browser:

* **positions come from ROSS.** A node is where `rotor.nodes_pos` says it is.
  The screen's own numbering (`getEffectiveNodes`) knows the order of the
  nodes, not their coordinates; and ROSS allows several shaft elements in one
  span (layers), which a running sum of lengths would stack end to end;
* **units come from ROSS.** Every form field carries its own unit (millimetres
  by default). Only the built elements hold the SI values, and converting in
  the browser would need a second copy of the unit table;
* **each part knows its row.** `index` is the element's position in its list
  on the screen, taken from `Assembled.placed` (domain/rotor_builder.py), so a
  click on a part opens the row that describes it.

Most elements have no shape in ROSS. A disk is a mass and two inertias; a
bearing is stiffness and damping at a node. Decided with Leonardo: a disk is
drawn as the **equivalent steel disk** -- the one with the same mass and polar
inertia, bored to the shaft it sits on -- so its size on screen means something
physical, and it is flagged as equivalent. A disk the project describes by its
dimensions (the "Geometry" form, `DiskElement.from_geometry`) is drawn with
those, and flagged as exact. Bearings, seals and point masses are drawn in
proportion to the shaft, as ROSS's 2D figure does, and carry no dimensions here.
